IPA Explorer 
=======================

These codes are created to allow easy exploration and visualization the results from ingenuity pathway analysis. Later on I will convert these to R/shiny apps to enable interactive plots. 


UpstreamRegulatorPlot.Rmd:
-----------

This code takes input from the IPA Upstream Analysis table, creates single plot that shows the top upstream regulators of each molecule type (e.g. transcription regulator, kinase, etc..) with their Activation Z-score and P value.
